Libft

My first own Library

The Libft project is the first step for students at 42 University to develop their own C library. In this project, you must recreate a set of functions from the C standard library (libc). Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals, with the difference that they will begin with the "ft_" prefix, e.g. "ft_strlen" instead of "strlen".
The functions you must recreate include basic string manipulation and memory management functions such as "ft_strlen", "ft_memset", "ft_memcpy", and "ft_strdup". Additionally, you must implement your own functions like "ft_substr", "ft_strjoin", "ft_strtrim", and "ft_split" that perform similar tasks but are not yet part of the standard library.
This project is designed to help you develop a deeper understanding of the inner workings of C libraries and improve your C programming skills. It is the foundation for your further work at 42 University.
